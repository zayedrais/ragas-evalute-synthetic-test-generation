# Evaluating Llama3 & Gemma2 & Test Generation on FreeÂ GPUs
The aims to assess a RAG pipeline using open-source LLMs like Llama3 and Gemma2, along with synthetic test generation on free GPU nodes. It doesn't focus on any specific RAG strategy.
In recent times, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is being utilized across various industries to address challenges in question-and-answer systems, chatbots, and search queries. To enhance the quality of responses, a robust pipeline is essential for evaluating RAG systems. In this context, we are using the Ragas library for performance assessment and synthetic test generation, along with Nuclia-Remi for evaluating RAG triad metrics.
